Notes to Grader:

- Camera controls are a little bit buggy but they work. Simply click and drag. 
- FPS and performance optimization is implemented with an average of 60 fps. 
- In order to use the sliders turn the animation off first. My double jointed sliders are the rear legs and rear flippers which can rotate indendently. 
- If the screen goes black when rotating it simply reset camera or refresh the page and it should work again. 
- Non-cube primitive: Cone.js
-Shift+click to see a different animation. Shift+click again to go back

Enjoy playing with Bowser!
