Notes to Grader:

The image I chose to draw out of triangles was a snowcapped mountain with grass at the bottom and snowflakes falling from the sky. My intial drawing on graph paper can be seen displayed on the asg1.html webpage. By clicking on the mountain button, you can see my rendering using our paint program. 

My unique feature I chose to add was a new "Ninja Star" paint brush in addition to our original Circle, Triangle, and Point brushes. You are able to adjust the segments on this star similar to the circle class, as well as change the color and size.
