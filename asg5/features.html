Notes to Grader:
For my submission download all the files and make sure you have them all in the same directory before opening index.html. This includes both cat.jpg and male02.obj as well as uv_grid_opengl.jpg. I am also running index.html through the live server feature in VS Code and testing it that way. For my 3d object .obj rendering I am using the code given on the threejs.org/examples website. When opening index.html, you will see my 3d textured spinning objects at the top of the page. Simply scroll down to view the 3d rendered .obj part of the assignment. Unfortunately once you scroll down you can not scroll back up to view the 3d objects again. I'm working on a way to fix this but I hope this is okay for this part of the assignment for now.
